# IBM_DS_CAPSTONE
Description:
This GitHub repository is dedicated to the Falcon 9 Landing Prediction Capstone project. The project aims to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully, which has significant implications for the cost of rocket launches. SpaceX offers Falcon 9 launches at a considerably lower cost compared to other providers, primarily due to the ability to reuse the first stage. This predictive model can be valuable for companies bidding against SpaceX for rocket launch contracts.
